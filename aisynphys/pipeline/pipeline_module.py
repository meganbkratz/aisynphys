class PipelineModule(object):
    """Pipeline modules represent analysis tasks that can be run independently of other parts of the analysis
    pipeline. 
    
    For any given experiment, a sequence of analysis stages must be processed in order. Each stage requires a specific
    set of inputs to be present, and produces/stores some output. Inputs and outputs can be raw data files, database tables,
    etc., although outputs are probably always written into a database. Each PipelineModule subclass represents a single stage
    in the sequence of analyses that occur across a pipeline.
    
    The work done by a single stage in the pipeline is divided up into jobs (units of work), where each stage may
    decide for itself what a suitable unit of work is. For many stages, the unit of work is the analysis done on a single experiment.
    Some stages may have finer granularity (multiple jobs per experiment), and some stages may have coarser granularity
    (multiple experiments per job), or even only have a single unit of work for the entire database, such as when aggregating 
    very high-level results.
    
    Note that PipelineModule classes generally need not implement any actual _analysis_; rather, they are simply responsible for
    data _management_ within the analysis pipeline. When an PipelineModule is asked to update an analysis result, it may call out to
    other packages to do the real work.
    
    From here, we should be able to:
    - Ask for which jobs this analysis has already been run (and when)
    - Ask for which jobs this analysis needs to be run (input dependencies are met and no result exists yet or is out of date)    
    - Run and store analysis for any specific experiment
    - Remove / re-run analysis for any specific experiment
    - Remove / re-run analysis for all jobs (for example, after a code change affecting all analysis results)
    - Initialize storage for analysis results (create DB tables, empty folders, etc.)
